## How To Use
To use this as a personal homepage, there are several extensions that can replace your new tab page with whatever you want. The one I use is [New Tab Redirect for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
## How to customize
To clone this, use git clone and then edit the files as needed within your favorite text editor (mine is Vim)
Please note that the projects script includes my github URL. If you would like to use your own, feel free to change.
