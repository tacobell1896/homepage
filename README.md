# homepage

To use this as a personal homepage, there are several extensions that can replace your new tab page with whatever you want. The one I use is [New Tab Redirect for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)

To clone this, use git clone and then edit the files as needed within your favorite text editor (mine is Vim)
